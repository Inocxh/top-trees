Main target of this thesis is to provide two different {\I Top Trees}
implementations and to compare them in different situations. Both implementation
were written from scratch in \Cpp{} to provide comparable results.

{\I Top Trees} are not so well known data structure which could be used to
maintain informations of some dynamically updated collection of trees. User of
this data structure defines four basic operations, which are called internally
when Top Trees structure is changing, and the structure updates internally
stored informations when there occurs some cutting or joining on underlying
trees.

This data structure could be used for example to dynamically maintain diameter,
center or median (minimizing weighted distance from all other vertices) of given
tree in time $\O(\log N)$ (where $N$ denotes the number of vertices).

Because it is essential to understand how the Top Trees structure works, some
basic principles of the Top Trees structure are introduced in the Chapter 1.

First implementation of the Top Trees structure is based on article {\I
Self-Adjusting Top Trees} \cite{SelfAdjustingTT} by Tarjan and Werneck. This
implementation promises quick amortized time per operations (with small
constant), but it does not guarantee these times in worst case. This
implementation is described in Chapter 2 of this thesis.

Second implementation is based on article {\I Maintaining Information in
Fully-Dynamic Trees with Top Trees} \cite{TopTrees} by Alstrup, Holm,
Lichtenberg and Thorup. This implementation promises time $\O(\log N)$ in
worst-case but with much larger multiplicative constant. This implementation is
described in Chapter 3 of this thesis.

To compare both implementations it was necessary to perform some experiments on
different problems on different trees with different sizes. Experiments were
performed on problems of \TODO{which problems?}. Details of these experiment
and their setup are described in Chapter 4.

After the experiments it turned out that
\TODO{after experiments add some basic conclusion here}.
More detailed results are described in Chapter 5.
