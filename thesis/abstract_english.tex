\maketitle

Definition and description of Top trees and introduction of problems solvable by
them including problem of edge 2-connectivity. Definition and description of
Topology trees used as one of the drivers for Top trees.

After the initial descriptions the two top trees implementations are introduced:
one based on self adjusting trees, second based on topology trees.
Comparison of these implementations is done by two experiments. Measurements
are discussed in conclusion -- results corresponds with initial estimates but
with different multiplicative constant than expected.
