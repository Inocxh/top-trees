\chapter{Implementation and usage}
\label{chap:Implementation}

As has beeen mentioned in the Introduction both implementation are writtten
in \Cpp. More precisely they are written in \Cpp11 with frequent use of smart
pointers introduced in \Cpp11, which helped a lot with memory handling.

Source code of both implementations is attached to this thesis including
Makefile for easier compiling and testing. Source code is also published on
Github, which may be more pleasant way to explore it or use it in other
projects:

\section{Interface of the Top Trees structure}

Both implementations share the same interface which makes them easily
interchangeable.

\section{Testing and Graphviz output}

Both implementations have debugging output showing their current state
in Graphviz format.

Graphviz is open source program which is able to visualize several types of
graphs (tree structures included). Both implementations are able to print
Graphviz script at their standard output and this script could be translated by
Graphviz program to a PDF image.

Currently user is able to visualize state of the structure after each operation
(Cut, Link or Expose) using ... \todo{Graphviz methods}
