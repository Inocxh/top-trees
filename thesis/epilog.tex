\chapter*{Conclusion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion}

There are two main products of this thesis: Implementations of Top trees
structure and results of experiments.

Both implementations were written from scratch in \Cpp{} and they are publicly
available for any usage -- as part of this thesis or as repository on Github
(mentioned in the \cref{chap:Implementation}). They both shares the same generic
interface, which allows to easily interchange them, so each user of them could
choose the one which better fits to his needs.

Also some other works may build upon this codebase and expand it (code is shared
under public licence). Both implementations were written with efficiency in
mind, but there are still places, where they could be tweaked for even better
performance. I will be pleased if there will be active users of this piece of
code.

\bigskip

Second product of this thesis are results of experiments discussed in the last
chapter. They showed \todo{complete after finishing of the experiments}

These results may help users of provided implementations to choose the right
implementation to fit their needs. Also other researchers in the field of Top
Trees may build upon these results.

\bigskip

And finally, important result of this thesis is a new knowledge which I earned
during working on it. It was an interesting journey through this complex data
structure, it teach me a lot of things about dynamic data structures. I hope,
that readers of this thesis would be at least half as much pleasure as I am.
